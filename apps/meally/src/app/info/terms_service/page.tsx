                Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an
                'as is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, Meally makes no
                warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and
                negates all other warranties including, without limitation,
                implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for
                a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual
                property, or other violation of rights.

              <br />
              <p>
                In no event shall Meally or its suppliers be liable for any
                consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third
                party arising from the use or inability to use this website or
                the materials on this website, even if Meally or an authorized

                In the context of this agreement, "consequential loss" includes
                any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss
                of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business,
                loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of
                reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data,
                whether under statute, contract, equity, tort (including
                negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.

              <p>
                Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
                warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
                incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
