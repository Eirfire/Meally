            Hi, my names Jacob and I am the founder of Meally. As a full-stack
            developer with a passion for cooking, I envisioned a platform that
            combines simplicity, ease of use, and a minimalistic approach to
            everything within the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meally was born out of the need for a website that offers
            straightforward features, easy navigation, clutter free, most
            importantly, is free!
          </p>
          <p>
            Meally has been built with the latest technologies and is constantly
            being updated with new features and improvements. We are always
            looking for new ways to improve the user experience and welcome any
            feedback or suggestions.
