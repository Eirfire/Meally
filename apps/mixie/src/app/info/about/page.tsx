            Hi, my names Jacob and I am the founder of Mixie. As a full-stack
            developer with a passion for cooking, I envisioned a platform that
            combines simplicity, ease of use, and a minimalistic approach to
            everything within the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mixie was born out of the need for a website that offers
            straightforward features, easy navigation, clutter free, most
            importantly, is free!
